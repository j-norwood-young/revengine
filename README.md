# RevEngine

RevEngine is an open source Data Management Platform for news publishers wanting to leverage their reader and content data. 

It gathers data from multiple sources to produce a single view of the reader, and feeds that information to other platforms in order to customise the reader's experience. 

It is developed by [Daily Maverick](https://dailymaverick.co.za) and Jason Norwood-Young, and funded by the Google News Initiative.

It is currently in development and not ready for production use.
